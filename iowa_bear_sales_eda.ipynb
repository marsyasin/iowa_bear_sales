    "We will be using the Iowa Liquor Sales Data Set. Please go to https://data.iowa.gov/Sales-Distribution/Iowa-Liquor-Sales/m3tr-qhgy/data_preview and download the Iowa Liquor Sales data set. It may take some time for you to download, upload, and process the functions based on your internet speed and computer, as it is a big data set with several million rows. When you do the following problems, you may run into issues related to the computer memory, time etc. Sampling data randomly by taking any fraction of the data from 30% to 100% based on how much your computer can handle is okay. Some numerical answers may be different for different students because of the sampling above ( which is fine with me), but the process is more important for you to go through for this homework. "
